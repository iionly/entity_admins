Description
-----------

The Entity Admins plugin allows entity owners to share control over certain entities with other users. The Entity Admins plugin doesn't add this option directly though but only provides the basic functionality to be used by other plugins. One example of a plugin that makes (optionally) use of the Entity Admins plugin is the Event Calendar plugin.


Installation
------------

1. If you have installed a previous version of the Entity Admins plugin plugin disable the plugin in the admin section of your site and then remove the entity_admins folder from the mod directory of your Elgg installation,
2. Copy the entity_admins folder into the mod directory of your Elgg installation,
3. Enable the Entity Admins plugin plugin in the admin section of your site.
