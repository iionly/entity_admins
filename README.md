Description
-----------

The Entity Admins plugin allows entity owners to share control over certain entities with other users. The Entity Admins plugin doesn't add this option directly though but only provides the basic functionality to be used by other plugins. One example of a plugin that makes (optionally) use of the Entity Admins plugin is the Event Calendar plugin.
